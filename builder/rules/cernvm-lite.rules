#
# The following ruleset defines how to create a CernVM lightweight
# Each line defines one of the following actions:
#
# * copy:<directory>[:<ignore> ...]
#
#   Copy the specified directory from the base system into the
#   guest filesystem. If the directory has not been previously
#   created, it will be created in the same way the 'writable'
#   directive works (see below). Optionally, you can specify a
#   list of additional directories that should be ignored from
#   the copy process.
#
# * [post-]readonly:<directory>
#
#   Read-only bind mount from the base filesystem into the guest
#   filesystem.
#
# * [post-]writable:<directory>[:<structure> ...]
#
#   Create a writable, blank directory on the location specified.
#   The second argument is the definition of the directory structure
#   to create upon creation of the base folder.
#
# * [post-]touch:<filename>
#
#   Create a blank filename in the specified path.
#
# * [post-]sh:<line>
#
#	Append the following line of code in the litescript.
#
# * set:<parameter>:<value>
# 
#   Set the value of various configurable parameters.
