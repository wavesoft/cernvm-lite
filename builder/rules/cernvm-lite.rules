#
# The following ruleset defines how to create a CernVM lightweight
# Each line defines one of the following actions:
#
# * copy:<directory>[:<ignore> ...]
#
#   Copy the specified directory from the base system into the
#   guest filesystem. If the directory has not been previously
#   created, it will be created in the same way the 'writable'
#   directive works (see below). Optionally, you can specify a
#   list of additional directories that should be ignored from
#   the copy process.
#
# * readonly:<directory>
#
#   Read-only bind mount from the base filesystem into the guest
#   filesystem.
#
# * writable:<directory>[:<structure> ...]
#
#   Create a writable, blank directory on the location specified.
#   The second argument is the definition of the directory structure
#   to create upon creation of the base folder.
#
# * touch:<filename>
#
#   Create a blank filename in the specified path.
#
# * sh:<line>
#
#	Append the following line of code in the litescript.
#

# Copy the /etc folder as it is
copy:etc

# Copy /var folder, excluding big parts that are rarely used
copy:var:var/lib/texmf var/cache/yum var/lib/yum/yumdb var/lib/rpm
readonly:var/lib/texmf
readonly:var/cache/yum
readonly:var/lib/yum/yumd
readonly:var/lib/rpm

# Make /home, /opt and /srv writable
writable:home
writable:opt
writable:srv

# Create /usr/local with appropriate structure
writable:/usr/local:{bin,etc,games,include,lib,lib64,libexec,sbin,src,share/{applications,info,perl5,man/man{1,1x,2,2x,3,3x,4,4x,5,5x,6,6x,7,7x,8,8x,9,9x,n}}}
